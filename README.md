# LLM Learnings Repository

A comprehensive collection of Large Language Model concepts, implementations, and experiments.
You should ideally have a understanding of deep learning and NLP fundamentals to make the most out of this repository.
This reportory is based on what I have learned from various resources and my own experiments with LLMs.
