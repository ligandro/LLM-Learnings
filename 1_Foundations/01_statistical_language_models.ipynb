    "## Key Takeaways\n",
    "\n",
    "### What We Learned\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Unigram Models** \n",
    "   - Simplest model: treats words independently\n",
    "   - Good baseline but ignores context\n",
    "\n",
    "2. **Bigram Models**\n",
    "   - Captures local context (previous word)\n",
    "   - Much better for natural language\n",
    "   - Can be extended to trigrams, n-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Smoothing**\n",
    "   - Essential for handling unseen word combinations\n",
    "   - Laplace smoothing is simple but effective\n",
    "   - Other methods: Good-Turing, Kneser-Ney\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Perplexity**\n",
    "   - Standard evaluation metric\n",
    "   - Lower is better\n",
    "   - Allows comparison between models\n",
    "\n",
    "### Limitations of Statistical LMs\n",
    "\n",
    "- **Data sparsity**: Need huge corpora for good coverage\n",
    "- **Limited context**: Bigrams only see 1 word back\n",
    "- **No semantic understanding**: Purely based on co-occurrence\n",
    "- **Storage**: Need to store counts for all n-grams\n",
    "\n",
    "### Modern Evolution\n",
    "\n",
    "Today's LLMs (GPT, BERT, etc.) overcome these limitations through:\n",
    "- **Neural networks**: Learn distributed representations\n",
    "- **Long-range context**: Attention mechanisms see entire sequences\n",
    "- **Semantic understanding**: Learn meaning, not just co-occurrence\n",
    "- **Efficient storage**: Parameters instead of explicit counts\n",
    "\n",
    "But statistical LMs remain important for understanding the foundations!"
